# Blackjack Game

This is a simple Blackjack game for Windows.

## How to Play

1.  Double-click the `.exe` file to run the game.
2.  A game window will open.
3.  You will start with a certain amount of virtual chips (or as specified in the game).
4.  The game will deal you two cards face-up and the dealer two cards (one face-up, one face-down).
5.  Your goal is to get a hand total as close to 21 as possible without going over (busting), and higher than the dealer's hand.
6.  You have the following actions available (usually through buttons or input fields):
    * **Hit:** Take another card.
    * **Stand:** Take no more cards.
    * **Double Down:** Double your initial bet and receive only one more card. (Availability may vary based on game rules).
    * **Split:** If you have two cards of the same rank, you can split them into two separate hands, requiring an additional bet equal to your initial bet. (Availability may vary based on game rules).
7.  After you stand (or bust), the dealer will reveal their face-down card and follow specific rules (usually hitting on 16 or less and standing on 17 or more).
8.  The winner of the round is determined based on the hand totals:
    * If your hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's without busting, you win.
    * If you get exactly 21 (Blackjack) on your initial two cards, you usually win a higher payout (e.g., 3:2).
    * If the dealer busts and you don't, you win.
    * If you bust, you lose, even if the dealer also busts.
    * If your hand and the dealer's hand have the same total (and neither is a Blackjack), it's usually a "push" (tie), and your bet is returned.
